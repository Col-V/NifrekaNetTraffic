# NifrekaNetTraffic
NifrekaNetTraffic is a simple WPF desktop program for Windows 10 and Windows 11 and displays information about the traffic of the current network interface.

**Visual Studio 2022** is recommended to build NifrekaNetTraffic.

The display refreshes approximately every 1 second.<br/>

In the case of multiple monitors, the window is moved to the selected corner of the monitor on which the window is already located.

Use the left mouse button to drag the window to any other position on one of the connected monitors.

When exiting, the last window position is preserved, so that NifrekaNetTraffic appears in the same place on the monitor as before the next time it is started. This information is saved in the file:

User folder -> Documents -> NifrekaNetTraffic -> NifrekaNetTraffic_Data -> NifrekaNetTraffic_Settings.DATA

If you delete the settings file, NifrekaNetTraffic will show up at the bottom right corner of the screen the next time it is started.

**Topmost:**
If this option is selected, the NifrekaNetTraffic window is always on top of other windows.

**Network:**
When switching the network connection, e.g. Ethernet > WLAN or back, this change is automatically detected by NifrekaNetTraffic.

**System requirements:**
Windows 10 or Windows 11
NET 6.0 Runtime
